+ Why Visualise? (Anscome's quartet)
+ Types of data
	+ (nominal, ordinal, quantitative, relational)
	+ (Number of dimentions, temporal, networks, ...)
+ Accuracy of quantitative perceptual tasks:
	+ From more to less accurate:
	+ position > length > angle/slope > area > volume > density/colour
+ Colour choice for norminal data: make sure no one colour dominates more than the others. Equal attention is important. Colour not good for many many variables (up to 10...)
+ Usually only one encoding to communicate the same information (unless in rare cases it's something you'd like to emphasise) e.g. using colour on a scatterplot to represent something that's already represented by an axis.

Nominal
+ Discrete
+ Mutually exclusive
+ No numerical relevance

Quantitative
+ Numeric, order \& distances
+ No abslute zero (\textit{interval})
+ Absolute zero

Ordinal
+ Order important
+ Distances unquantifiable
+ Typically non-numeric

Relational
+ Describes relationships between discrete objects
